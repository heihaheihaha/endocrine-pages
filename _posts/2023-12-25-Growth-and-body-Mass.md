## Growth Hormone (GH)

### GH - A family of hormones with overlapping activaties

生长激素/催乳素激素家族

GH appears to be a single-copy gene, but four other hormones have significant homology to GH: placental-variant GH (pvGH), human chorionic somatomammotropins 1 and 2 (hCS1 and hCS2), and **human prolactin (PRL)**.

- human prolactin ([PRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolactin))

## GH is secreted in a pulsatile manner
![GH secreted period](/assets/GH_brust.png)

Secreted by [Somatotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotropic_cell) cell, which constitute about 30−40% of anterior pituitary cells.

the increased GH output results from an increase in the frequency of pulses of GH secretion by the somatotrophs

## Growth Hormone-releasing Hormone (GHRH)

一种由氨基酸组成的**肽**激素，在**下丘脑的弓状核**中产生

## Growth Hormone-releasing Hormone Recptor (GHRHR)

GHRH binds to a **G protein–coupled receptor** (GPCR) on the somatotrophs and activates Gαs, which in turn stimulates [adenylyl cyclase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_monophosphate). The subsequent rise in [cAMP]i causes increased gene transcription and synthesis of GH. In addition, the rise in [cAMP]i opens Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and causes [Ca2+]i to rise. This increase in [Ca2+]i stimulates the release of preformed GH.

In conclusion, two ascepts and two steps:
1. GHRH -> GHRHR -> Gαs -> [cAMP]i -> gene **transcription and synthesis** of GH
2. GHRH -> GHRHR -> Gαs -> [cAMP]i -> Ca2+ channels -> [Ca2+]i -> **release** of preformed GH

## Ghrelin(胃泌素，饥饿素？)
> Distinct endocrine cells within the mucosal layer of the stomach release ghrelin in response to **fasting**. Endocrine cells throughout the GI tract also make ghrelin, although the highest ghrelin concentrations are in **the fundus of the stomach**. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus also makes small amounts of ghrelin. Ghrelin appears to be involved in the **postmeal stimulation of growth hormone secretion**. Ghrelin also is orexigenic, thereby contributing to body mass regulation as well as linear growth.

- secreted by GI tract, especially the fundus of the stomach, also by the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus(下丘脑弓状核)
- stimulates GH secretion

### Ghrelin Receptor
> The hormone ghrelin binds to a GPCR designated GH secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a). This receptor is like the GHRH receptor (GHRHR); however, GHSR1a does not bind GHRH.

## [Somatostatin, SST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin), growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH) 生长抑素
Synthesized by [hypothalamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus), is a 14-amino acid peptide that inhibits GH secretion. 

> The hypothalamus also synthesizes SST, a 14–amino-acid neuropeptide. SST is made in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus and is secreted into the hypophyseal portal blood supply. It is a potent inhibitor of GH secretion. \
It appears that the primary regulation of GH secretion is **stimulatory**, because sectioning the pituitary stalk, and thereby interrupting the portal blood flow from the hypothalamus to the pituitary, leads to a decline in GH secretion. It also appears that the pulses of GH secretion are entrained by the pulsatile secretion of GHRH (as opposed to the periodic loss of SST inhibition).

### SST Receptor
> SS binds to a GPCR called SSTR found on somatotrophs and activates Gαi, which **inhibits** adenylyl cyclase(腺苷酸环化酶). As a result, [Ca2+]i decreases, which diminishes the responsiveness of the somatotroph to GHRH. When somatotrophs are exposed to both GHRH and SST, the inhibitory action of SST *prevails*.

- SS -> SSTR -> Gαi -| adenylyl cyclase 
- -| [Ca2+]i -> diminishes the responsiveness of the somatotroph to GHRH

## Both GH and IGF-1 are negative feedback on GH secretion by somatotrophs

> Somatotroph secretion of GH is under negative-feedback control via IGF-1. **GH triggers the secretion of IGF-1** from GH target tissues throughout the body. Indeed, IGF-1 mediates many of the growth-promoting actions of GH. IGF-1 synthesized in tissues such as muscle, cartilage, and bone may act in a **paracrine or autocrine** fashion to promote local tissue growth. In contrast, circulating IGF-1, largely derived from hepatic secretion, exerts endocrine effects. Circulating IGF-1 **suppresses** GH secretion through both direct and indirect mechanisms. \
First, circulating IGF-1 exerts a direct action on the pituitary to suppress GH secretion by the somatotrophs. In its peripheral target cells, IGF-1 acts through a receptor tyrosine kinase(酪氨酸激酶) and not by either the Ca2+ or cAMP messenger systems. IGF-1 presumably acts by this same mechanism to inhibit GH secretion in somatotrophs. \
Second, circulating IGF-1 inhibits GH secretion via two indirect feedback pathways, both targeting the hypothalamus. IGF-1 suppresses GHRH release and also increases SST secretion. \
GH itself appears to inhibit GH secretion in a short-loop feedback system.

- IGF-1 may act as a **paracrine or autocrine** hormone, which means it acts locally.
- The free freeIGF-1 largely derived from ***hepatic secretion***
- GH -| GH
- circulating IGH-1 -> [SST + ; GHRH -]
- IGH-1 acts through a receptor ***tyrosine kinase(酪氨酸激酶)*** and not by either the Ca2+ or cAMP messenger systems

## GH has short-term anti-insulin metabolic effects aswell as long-term growth-promoting effects mediatedby IGF-1

GH: short-term anti-insulin metabolic effects
IGF-1: long-term growth-promoting effects

---
> Once secreted, most GH circulates free in the plasma. However, a significant fraction (∼40% for the 22-kDa GH) is complexed to a **GH-binding protein** formed by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of GH receptors in GH target tissues. This protein fragment binds to GH with high affinity, thereby increasing the half-life of GH and competing with GH target tissues for GH. In the circulation, GH has a half-life of ∼25 minutes.

### Growth Hormone Receptor

> GH binds to a receptor (GHR) on the surface of multiple target tissues. GHR is a **tyrosine kinase–associated receptor** (like IGH-1 receptor). When one GH molecule simultaneously binds to sites on two GHR monomers and acts as a bridge, the monomers dimerize. Receptor occupancy increases the activity of a tyrosine kinase (JAK2 family) that is associated with the GH receptor. This tyrosine kinase triggers a series of protein phosphorylations that modulate target cell activity.

- GH使得GHR二聚化

### Short-Term Effects of Growth Hormone

> GH has certain short-term (minutes to hours) actions on muscle, adipose tissue, and liver that may not necessarily be related to the more long-term growth-promoting actions of GH. These acute metabolic effects include stimulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue, inhibition of glucose uptake by muscle, and stimulation of gluconeogenesis by hepatocytes. These actions **oppose the normal effects of insulin** on these same tissues and have been termed the anti-insulin or diabetogenic actions of GH.

- stimulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue 刺激脂肪组织中的脂解作用
- inhibition of glucose uptake by muscle 抑制肌肉对葡萄糖的摄取
- stimulation of gluconeogenesis by hepatocytes 刺激肝细胞的糖异生

#### Diabetogenic Effects of GH
| Target           | Effect              |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Muscle           | ↓ Glucose uptake    |
| Fat              | ↑ Lipolysis         |
| Liver            | ↑ Gluconeogenesis   |
| Muscle, fat, and liver | Insulin resistance  |

>>>>diabetogenic<<<<

> It is now appreciated that replacement of GH in adults with GH deficiency leads to increased lean **body mass**, decreased **body fat**, and perhaps an increased sense of **vigor** or well-being

- secreted by anterior pituitary
- stimulates liver to produce IGF-1
- stimulates bone growth
- stimulates protein synthesis
- stimulates lipolysis
- stimulates gluconeogenesis

### Long-Term Effects of Growth Hormone

> Distinct from these acute actions of GH is its action to promote tissue growth by stimulating target tissues to produce another circulating factor that mediates further actions of GH. This intermediate, termed somatomedin because it mediates the somatic effects of GH, is in fact two peptides resembling proinsulin and thus termed insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2. Indeed, the IGFs exert insulin-like actions in isolated adipocytes and can produce hypoglycemia in animals and humans. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are made in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, muscle, cartilage, and bone. The liver produces most of the circulating IGF-1, which more closely relates to GH secretion than does IGF-2.

GH -> IGF-1/2

# Growth-Promoting Hormones

## IGF-1 is the principal mediator of the growth-promoting action of GH

> The synthesis of IGF-1 and, to a lesser extent, IGF-2 depends on **circulating GH**. The periodic nature of GH secretion results in a wide range of plasma GH concentrations. In contrast, plasma [IGF-1] does not vary by more than ∼2-fold over a 24-hour period. The plasma [IGF-1] in effect integrates the pulsatile, highly fluctuating GH concentration. The reason is that IGF-1 circulates bound to several IGF-1–binding proteins. These binding proteins are made principally in the liver, but they are also manufactured by other tissues. At least six distinct IGF-binding proteins have been identified. The local free fraction of IGF-1 is probably the more biologically active component that binds to the receptor and stimulates tissue growth.

- GH 变化幅度大，但是 IGF-1 变化幅度较小，因为 IGF-1 与多种（At least six） IGF-1 结合蛋白结合，这些结合蛋白由肝脏合成，但也由其他组织合成。
- 局域游离的 IGF-1 可能是更具生物学活性的成分，它与受体结合并刺激组织生长。

> IGF-1 and IGF-2 are secreted into the extracellular space, where they may act locally in a **paracrine** fashion. In the extracellular space, the IGFs encounter binding proteins that may promote local retention of the secreted hormone by increasing the overall molecular size of the complex.

molecular size of the complex + -> local retention of the secreted hormone

I guess: the larger size of the complex may make it less likely to diffuse away quickly...

---

> Whether made locally or reaching tissues through the circulation, IGF-1 acts via a specific receptor tyrosine kinase , a heterotetramer that is **structurally related to the insulin receptor**. Like the insulin receptor the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) has two extracellular α chains and two transmembrane β chains. The β chains have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of IGF-1 to its receptor enhances receptor autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of downstream effectors. The structural homology between the insulin and IGF-1 receptors is sufficiently high that insulin can bind to the IGF-1 receptor, although with an affinity that is about two orders of magnitude less than that for IGF-1. The same is true for the binding of IGF-1 to insulin receptors. The homology between the insulin and IGF-1 receptors is so strong that hybrid receptors containing one α-β chain of the insulin receptor and one α-β chain of the IGF-1 receptor are present in many tissues. **These hybrid receptors bind both insulin and IGF-1, but their affinity for IGF-1 is greater.**

- homology between the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, hybrid receptors

![484](/assets/GH484.png)

> IGF-1 is less effective in mimicking insulin’s action on adipose and liver tissue; in humans, these tissues have few IGF-1 receptors. In muscle, IGF-1 promotes the uptake of amino acids and stimulates protein synthesis at concentrations that do not stimulate glucose uptake. Thus, IGF-1 promotes growth at lower circulating concentrations than those required to produce hypoglycemia.

- IGF-1 模拟胰岛素的作用，但是肝脏和脂肪组织中的 IGF-1 受体较少，所以 IGF-1 在这些组织中的作用较弱。
- 在肌肉中，IGF-1促进氨基酸的摄取，并在不刺激葡萄糖摄取的浓度下刺激蛋白质合成。因此，IGF-1在血糖低于需要调控降血糖的循环浓度下促进生长。

## IGF-2 acts similarly to IGF-1 but is less dependent on GH
> The physiology of IGF-2 differs from that of IGF-1 both in terms of control of secretion and receptor biology. Regarding control of secretion, IGF-2 levels depend less on circulating GH than do IGF-1 levels. \
Regarding receptor biology, although IGF-2 binds to the IGF-1 receptor, it preferentially binds to the so-called IGF-2 receptor (IGF2R). This IGF-2 receptor is a single-chain polypeptide that is structurally very distinct from the IGF-1 receptor and is not a receptor tyrosine kinase. \
IGF-2 shares with IGF-1 (and also with insulin) the ability to promote tissue growth and to cause acute hypoglycemia.

# Growth rate parallels plasma levels of IGF-1 except early and late in life
主要指青春期——puberty

> During **puberty**, the greatest growth rates are observed at times when plasma [IGF-1] is highest. A similar comparison can be made using GH, provided care is taken to obtain multiple measurements at each age and thereby account for the pulsatile secretion and marked diurnal changes that occur in plasma [GH].
During puberty, growth rate parallels plasma [IGF-1].The two parameters diverge at both younger and older ages. A first period of life for this divergence is very early childhood, which is characterized by a very rapid longitudinal growth rate, but quite low IGF-1 levels. Children with complete GH deficiency have very low plasma [IGF-1] levels but are of normal length and weight at birth. This observation suggests that during intrauterine life, factors other than GH and IGF-1 are important regulators of growth. One of these additional factors may be insulin. Another may be that IGF-2 is an important mediator of intrauterine growth. Plasma [IGF-2] is greater during fetal life than later and peaks just before birth. Plasma [IGF-2] plummets soon after birth, but then it gradually doubles between birth and age 1 year, and remains at this level until at least the age of 80 years.
By age 3 or 4 years, GH and IGF-1 begin to play major roles in the regulation of growth. The concentrations of these hormones rise throughout childhood and peak during the time of the pubertal growth spurt. The rate of long-bone growth in the pubertal growth spurt is exceeded only during intrauterine life and early childhood. The frequency of pituitary GH secretory pulses increases markedly at puberty because both estradiol and testosterone appear to promote GH secretion.
During adulthood, longitudinal growth essentially ceases, yet secretion of GH and of IGF-1 continues to be highly regulated, although the circulating concentrations of both hormones decline during aging. GH and IGF-1 remain important regulators of body composition and appear to promote anabolic actions in muscle. Some investigators have suggested that supplementing normal adults with GH or IGF-1 may reverse some of the effects of aging, including loss of muscle mass, negative nitrogen balance, and osteoporosis.
Nutritional factors also modulate both GH secretion and IGF-1 production. In both children and adults, GH secretion is triggered by high dietary protein intake. Conversely, fasting, is associated with a decline in IGF-1 even with increased GH.

- **estradiol and testosterone** promote GH secretion
- high dietary protein intake -> GH secretion
- fasting -> decline in IGF-1 even with increased GH

# Thyroid hormones, steroids, and insulin also promote growth

## Thyroid Hormones

长骨和脑的发育需要甲状腺激素

## Steroids

> Androgen or estrogen excess occurring before the pubertal growth spurt accelerates bone growth. However, the sex steroids also accelerate the rate at which the skeleton matures and thus shorten the time available for growth before epiphyseal closure occurs.

青春期发育高峰前出现的雄激素或雌激素过量会加速骨骼生长。然而，性类固醇也会加快骨骼的成熟速度，从而缩短骨骺闭合前的生长时间。

## Glucocorticoids 糖皮质激素

> An excess of adrenal glucocorticoids inhibits growth. Growth ceases in children who produce too much cortisol, as a result of either adrenal or pituitary tumors. The use of synthetic glucocorticoids in treating various serious illnesses (e.g., asthma, organ transplantation, various chronic autoimmune processes) also can arrest growth. Restoration of normal growth does not occur until the glucocorticoid levels return toward normal. Because linear growth is related to cartilage and bone synthesis at the growth plates, glucocorticoids presumably are acting at least in part at these sites to impair growth. In adults, as in children, glucocorticoid excess impairs tissue anabolism and thus may manifest as wasting in some tissues (e.g., bone, muscle, subcutaneous connective tissue).
In glucocorticoid deficiency, growth is not substantially affected. However, other deleterious effects of cortisol deficiency (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypotension, weakness;) dominate.

过量的肾上腺糖皮质激素会抑制生长。由于肾上腺或垂体肿瘤，产生过多皮质醇的儿童生长停止。使用合成糖皮质激素治疗各种严重疾病（如哮喘、器官移植、各种慢性自身免疫过程）也会阻止生长。直到糖皮质激素水平恢复正常，才能恢复正常生长。由于线性生长与生长板处的软骨和骨合成有关，糖皮质激素可能至少部分作用于这些部位，从而损害生长。在成人和儿童中，糖皮质激素过量会损害组织合成代谢，因此可能在某些组织（如骨骼、肌肉、皮下结缔组织）中表现为消耗。
在糖皮质激素缺乏症中，生长不会受到实质性影响。然而，皮质醇缺乏的其他有害影响（如低血糖、低血压、虚弱）占主导地位。

|Glucocorticoids|缺乏|过多|
|---------------|----|----|
|Growth|不受影响|抑制（糖皮质激素可能至少部分作用于骨骺）|
|Tissue anabolism|不受影响|损害|
|Other effects|低血糖、低血压、虚弱|肥胖、高血压、糖尿病|

## Insulin

> Insulin is also an important growth factor, particularly in utero. Women with diabetes frequently have high blood levels of glucose during pregnancy and deliver babies of high birth weight (fetal macrosomia). The developing fetus exposed to glucose concentrations that are higher than normal secretes additional insulin. Hyperinsulinemia results in increased fetal growth.
Conversely, infants born with pancreatic agenesis or with one of several forms of severe insulin resistance are very small at birth.

- Mothers with diabetes -> high blood levels of glucose -> high birth weight
- Infants born with pancreatic agenesis or with one of several forms of severe insulin resistance -> very small at birth

# Regulation of Body Mass
glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids, as well as hormones such as insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, all play important roles in the regulation of body mass.

Macronutrients:
- glucose
- fatty acids
- amino acids

Hormones:
- insulin
- leptin
- ghrelin

## The balance between energy intake and expenditure determines body mass
## Energy expenditure comprises resting metabolic rate, activity-related energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis
## Hypothalamic centers control the sensations of satiety and hunger
## Leptin tells the brain how much fat is stored
## Letpin and insulin are oxyanorexigenic signals for the hypothalamus
## Ghrelin is an orexigenic signal for the hypothalamus
